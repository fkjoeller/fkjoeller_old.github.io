K., Pedersen, R. T., & Albæk, E. (2021). No Gender Bias in Audience Perceptions of Male and Female Experts in the News: Equally Competent and Persuasive. The International Journal of Press/Politics, OnlineFirst.\nOpen Access version\nCode and replication data\n\nWork in progress\nReward or Punishment? The Distribution of Life-Cycle Returns to Political Office with Jens Olav Dahlgaard and Nicolai Kristensen\nWe estimate the economic returns to winning office focusing on close winning and losing candidates running for Danish national elections. We devote special attention to 1) effect heterogeneity among candidates with different pre-office income potentials and 2) the timing of returns to office, as some economic consequences of holding office occur immediately when entering office while others occur later in life.\nUnder review. Working paper version here\n\nGender Balanced Work Environments Improve Women’s Political Representation? with Jens Olav Dahlgaard, Benjamin Egerod and Lene Holm Pedersen.\nWe investigate if the election of a woman for office foster female representation in future elections and beyond the candidate herself. We do this by focusing on local elections, where a woman marginally wins a seat over a man competing for the same seat, and estimate what this means to the composition of the future candidate pools and thus how it shapes the supply of political candidates.\n\nAmateurs in Office: Monetary and Job Market Returns to Part-Time Officeholding\nI estimate how holding a part-time political office affect income and civil career of Danish local councilors. Concerning the latter, I specifically investigate what being a local councilor do to the councilors labour supply and probability of being promoted in their outside job.\n\nHow Does Increased Policy Discretion Change the Politicial Class? Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment\nI estimate how increased policy discretion in office affect whether incumbents’ rerun and freshmen’s decide to run and who eventually win. Thus, I estimate how policy discretion can be seen as a motivational factor that change the supply of political candidates and change the composition of the political class.\n\nGovernment Ideology and Gender Equality in Public Sector Promotions with Lasse Aaskoven and Benjamin Egerod\nRelying on granular data of the universe of Danish civil servants, we estimate how women’s career progression in the Danish bureaucracy depend on the ideology of the government in office.\n\nPreferences for power, time, money and non-sexist working environments among political candidates with Lene Holm Pedersen\nWe investigate political candidates’ preferences for different job attributes of holding office using a conjoint-choice experiment fielded among the political candidates in the Danish municipal election in November 2021.\n\n\n\n",
