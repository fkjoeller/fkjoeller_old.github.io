The Distribution of Life-Cycle Returns\nto Political Office with Jens Olav Dahlgaard and Nicolai\nKristensen. Under review. Working paper version here\nWe estimate the economic returns to winning office focusing on close\nwinning and losing candidates running for Danish national elections. We\ndevote special attention to 1) effect heterogeneity among candidates\nwith different pre-office income potentials and 2) the timing of returns\nto office, as some economic consequences of holding office occur\nimmediately when entering office while others occur later in life.\n\nWhen the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Gets Going – Victims of\nSexism and Harassment in the Candidate Pool State Stronger Preferences\nfor Political Influence with Lene Holm Pedersen. Under\nreview.\nWe investigate political candidates’ preferences for different job\nattributes of holding office using a conjoint-choice experiment fielded\namong the political candidates in the Danish municipal election in\nNovember 2021.\n\nGovernment Ideology and Gender Equality in Public Sector\nPromotions with Lasse Aaskoven and Benjamin Egerod.\nSubmitted.\nRelying on granular data of the universe of Danish civil servants,\nwe estimate how women’s career progression in the Danish bureaucracy\ndepend on the ideology of the government in office.\n\nIncreased Representation of Women Improves The Electoral\nPerformance of Political Parties with Jens Olav Dahlgaard,\nBenjamin Egerod and Lene Holm Pedersen. Submitted\nWe investigate if the election of a woman for office foster female\nrepresentation in future elections and beyond the candidate herself. We\ndo this by focusing on local elections, where a woman marginally wins a\nseat over a man competing for the same seat, and estimate what this\nmeans to the composition of the future candidate pools and thus how it\nshapes the supply of political candidates.\n\nPolitician or Employee? The Career Benefits of Holding a\nPart-Time Political Office\nI estimate how holding a part-time political office affect income\nand civil career of Danish local councilors. Concerning the latter, I\nspecifically investigate what being a local councilor do to the\ncouncilors labour supply and probability of being promoted in their\noutside job.\n\nPolicy Motivation and Political Selection: Does Policy\nDiscretion Retain Politicians?\nI estimate how increased policy discretion in office affect whether\nincumbents’ rerun and freshmen’s decision to run and who eventually win.\nThus, I estimate how policy discretion can be seen as a motivational\nfactor that change the supply of political candidates and change the\ncomposition of the political class.\n\n\n\n",
